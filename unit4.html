        <br>&emsp;1835/36 - Sam Houston led a revolution against Mexico; “Lone Star Republic” formed. Jackson rejects Texas bid
        for annexation because he wants to avoid the sectional conflicts over slavery. MVB also ignores this issue
        <br>&emsp;Northerners saw the annexation of texas as a southern conspiracy to expand slavery because Texas would
        definitely be a slave state

        Mexican territory
        <br>&emsp;-Polk stationed his troops (Zachary Taylor) in the disputed land and waited for Mexico to attack them so that he
        could frame this as a defensive war
        <br>&emsp;-In his message to congress, he blamed Mexico for the cause of the war and said we need to defend ourselves cause
        they invaded America
        <br>&emsp;-The Whigs didn’t like how Polk instigated the war but they still supported the war effort because they didn’t
        want to be branded as traitors like the Federalists after the Hartford Convention
        <br>&emsp;-Polk said the war already had began so undercut Congress power
        <br>&emsp;-U.S. declares war May 1846<br>

        <br>&emsp;&emsp;-MVB was the Free Soil party candidate in the 1848 election, funny how he created the democratic party in order

        slavery’s growth
        <br>&emsp;-Lewis Cass (Democratic Nominee) - Popular Sovereignty to decide slavery (was very popular becuase seemed like

        <br>&emsp;<b>-New Fugitive Slave Act:</b> the federal government is responsible to hunt down fugitive slaves in the north and
        return them to the slaveowners. No jury trial. This brings the realities and horrors of slavery to the north
        where they tried to distance themselves from this institution
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;-There was an economic incentive as well (10 dollars for capturing and 5 dollars for freeing)

        Slave Acts and to protect escaped slaves and free blacks settled in the North.

        <br>&emsp;-1856 Election: James Buchanan (Democrat)
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;-Fake northerner just pacified the south
        <br>
        <br>&emsp;-LeCompton Constitution (1857): Pro-slavery constitution written by Kansas, there was a clearly fradulent
        election but Buchanan accepts it because he largely won due to the southerners and this was a southern policy,

        sues and goes to supreme court
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;-1. Scott cannot sue
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;-2. Blacks can never be citizens
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;-3. Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional (slaves are property so they can’t be taken away just based off of

        <br>&emsp;&emsp;-Lincoln gives “House Divided” speech
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;-U.S. can not exist if it is half slavery and half free - free soil position
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;-Douglas gives the “Freeport Doctrine”

        <br>&emsp;-March 4th, 1861: Lincoln inaugurated
        <br>
        
        <br><font size = "+1">Why does the South Secede?</font>
        <br>&emsp;-They see the 1860 election as a blueprint because Lincoln didn’t receive a single vote in the south yet he still
        won
        <br>&emsp;-Lincoln is against the expansion of slavery as well so no new states will be Slave states so their
        representation is only going to decrease over time
        <br>&emsp;-Crittenden Plan: compensation for owners of runaway slaves, repeal or personal liberty laws, and a 13th
        amendment prohibiting the federal government’s interference with slavery in the south, and another to restore
        missouri compromise.<br>

        <br>&emsp;-After this, Virginia, NC, Arkansas, and Tennessee joined the confederacy
        <br>
        <br>&emsp;-Fight was not about slavery in the north, it was just to punish secession but clearly the south was fighting to
        protect slavery

        <br>&emsp;-Fredericksburg: major union defeat
        <br><br>&emsp;-Antietam: TURNING POINT bloodiest battle. British and french were thihkning of giving some support to the south

        <br>&emsp;-NYC Draft Riot (1863): There was a rule that if you paid 300 dollars you could not fight and get somebody else
        to fight for you so it created the idea that this was a rich man's war but a poor man's fight

            1852 : Franklin Pierce (D) , Scott (Whig), Hale (FS)
                The Whig party disappeared in 1854 due to sectional conflict over the Kansas-Nebraska Act
            Conscience Whigs: northern based whigs who didnt want the expansion of slavery went on to form the Free Soil party
            Cotton Whigs: southern whigs, conservative,
            Southern Whigs went to the Know Nothing party (anti-catholic, nativist)
            Free Soil Party went to the Republican Party
            1856: Buchanan (D), Fremont (Republican), Fillmore (Know Nothing)
            Democratic party split into Southern Democrats and Northern Democrats
            The southern democrats didn’t want Douglas to become nominee because he was for popular sovereignty and since
            the north had more people the new states would all come in as free states so when he won the nomination they all left
        
            Northern Know Nothing Party members went to the republican party
            1860: Douglas(N. Dem), Breckenridge (S. Dem), Lincoln (republican), Bell (const. Union)
            Ostend Manifesto: advocated the U.S. seizure of Cuba from Spain
                - Didn’t happen because of northern opposition
                - Couple of louisiana farmers were also against the seizure of Cuba because cuban sugar would compete with their own. 
            Republican Party was created in 1854
                - Won election in 1860
                - Primarily based out of New England
                - Power from former whigs and discontent democrats
                - There are no southern Republicans
                - In 1856 Fremont won parts of the northwest
                - In the 1858 congressional election there was a republican increase in seats
                - In 1860 Lincoln was elected by sweeping the North
