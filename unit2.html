            - NO BILL OF RIGHTS ( most state constitutions had bill of rights)

            - Wants wealthy, unified government (weaken the states)
            - Wants the US to be powerful and finances are important for this because if you have a bad credit score no one
            will loan you money
            - Wants to tie the wealthy to the government
            - MAKES BONDS: public faith in government and so people will be more likely to lend money
            - Assumption: 20 - 24 million dollar stat edebts assumed by national govt.
                - Increases central govt. Power because the people will feel a stronger sense of nationalism 
                towards the central ggovernment not their state since it is them who is paying the citizens

        <font size = "+2">Thomas Jefferson vs. Alexander Hamilton</font>

            - Core disagreements
            - Economic future of the United States
                - Hamilton wants a mercantile future with lots of trading but industrial trading
                - Jefferson wants an agrarian future as he is from the south. Mostly farmers
            - Foreign Policy
                - Washington and Alexander Hamilton argue for neutrality all the time
                    - Declaration of neutrality (1793) makes Jefferson quit as state
                - Jefferson is extremely pro france and wants to go help in the french revolution
            - Size and Power of the Central Government
                - AH wants a much larger central government
                - TJ wants the states to have more power
            - Interpretation of the Constitution
                - Elastic clause says that Congress can pass any law that is necessary to carry out the enumerated powers listed
                - Alexander Hamilton has a very loose interpretation of this
                - Thomas Jefferson has a very strict interpretation of this
            - Security of Transfer
                - Hamilton argues that if a bond is transferred than the bond belongs to the person that bought it not to the
                person who originally had it
                    - No security of transfer means no trust in government meaning no wealthy tied to government interests
                - Jefferson and Madison argue that bonds need to be given to people who originally had it
        
            Specific Examples of these disagreements
                - Bank of US

                    - TJ thought it would benefit the northern elite

                    - Ultimately put down when an army was mustered by washington and hamilton
                    - Comes to notion that we need another party to represent the will and thoughts
                    of the commoners against the federalists
                    - Growth of politically based newspapers (National Gazette - Jeffersionian and Gazette of US - federalist)
        
        <font size = "+2">French Revolution</font>
            - Hamilton believes US interests are not aligned with this and it will just hurt US growth
                - We can not be getting into another war with the British because US trade is based off of England
            - Jefferson believes that since the French are fighting for American ideals we need to support them (the same
            liberty we wanted from the British)
                -Treaty with the French so we have an obligation to fulfil it
                - TJ lived there for a while so a little bit biased

            - Divisions and factions (parties)
                - NE is shown to be Federalist
                - South and west is shown to be Jeffersonian Republican
            - V.P. is Thomas Jefferson ( greatest political competitior at the time)

        <font size = "+2">Quasi War</font>

                    - <b>Nullification</b>: state can declare null and void any act they deem unconstitutional
                - Federalists do this because they believe that officers were slandered so much to the point where they can not be
                disinterested
        <b>DUMPING</b>
            - Practice by the british where they flooded the market with their goods in order to make it very hard for the
            young america
