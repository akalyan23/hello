      Spain was no obstacle but France was the strongest in Europe and posed a threat to American empire of liberty

      <b>Santo Domingo:</b> the Haitian slave rebellion which persuaded Napoleon to not pursue western hemisphere so allowed louisiana purchase to happen

        - Gets france out of america (might force american to be closer to british jefferson hated the british)

        - The U.S. prospered by taking sugar and coffee from the french and spanish caribbean colonies to europe
        
        British Rule of 1756 - any trade closed during peacetime can’t be opened during war (France usually restricted sugar trade to just french ships in peacetime so they can’t give that trade to American ships now)
        Broken voyage: Americans took the goods to U.S. ports, unload it, pass through customs, and re-export as American produce
        Britain and France started seizing American ships
          - Impressment (british took people from American ships and put them in the royal navy)
        <b>Peaceable Coercion:</b> suspending trade with Britain and France for neutral rights
        <b>Embargo Act(1807):</b> embargo on all foreign nations really upset new englanders lots seamen lost jobs
          - British found markets in south america
        Non-Intercourse Act (1809): weaker version of embargo act, opened trade to all nations except france or britain but if either country stopped violating neutral rights it would restore trade with that one
        Macon’s Bill 2: opened trade with britain and france if either repealed restrictions on neutral shipping US would stop trade with other
        War hawks demanded war (Henry Clay, Calhoun)
        Tecumseh: Shawnee Chief. Tried to build a coalition of western tribes to stem white settlement of their lands. Allied with British in war of 1812
        Battle of Tippecanoe (1812): William H. Harrison defeats Tecumseh. Creates national hero W.H.H
        Madison’s War Message

      <b>War of 1812:</b> America v British  
        - Created strong nationalism 
        - Eliminated federalist party as strong opposing force

      Proved the U.S. is capable of fighting war while keeping liberty
      <b>Treaty of Ghent:</b> status quo antebellum (nothing changed after the war except the fact britain and america not at war)

      <b>The Hartford Convention:</b> To voice the New Englanders troubles (demise of federalist party made them look like traitors)
        - Abolish ⅗ clause because gave south too much representation
        - Require ⅔ of congress to declare war and to admit new states into the union
        - Limit president to one term
        - Prohibit election of two successive presidents from same state

          1828 election was vicious but jackson was more of a common man and hence won by a lot

        First thing Jackson did was <b>rotation in office</b> - removal of officeholders from previous administration of rival party.

      MVB inherited the Depression of 1837
        - To solve this he created independent treasury of the united states
        - Basically just took all federal money and placed it in treasury
        - Very very inflationary

      In 1840 the Whigs only ran WHH confident they would win because the depression was mainly blamed on MVB
